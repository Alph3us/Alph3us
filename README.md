Hey, Iâ€™m @Alph3us or Dallas
<br>
I do coding as a hobby. Might look into it for job prospects in the future, but it's currently for fun and personal projects. 
Though, I'm the kind of person who makes spreadsheets for fun haha (it is, though)<br>
I know three languages: English, French, and a conlang called Toki Pona that has helped me a lot.<br><br>

Most of my "content" is going to be personal projects and other things. I try to do a lot of pretty looking themes and the like.<br><br>
